I owe the reader an explanation for all of this.

I had come to point with my 3d printer design and build where i wanted to explore using
cnc machined parts from aluminum.  I had seen other designers doing this
and i thought it was a good design route if one was wanting to have a very robust 
machine.  There was a problem though, the companies that offered this service
were demanding what i thought was a high price for the service and i was unwilling
to pay this amount.  I thought with my experience of designing a 3d printer
surely i could design a cnc router since most if not all of the components
themselves were the same.  So i got to it designing up a small frame for the
cnc router.  I wanted to approach this like a lot of my builds and reuse or
recycle as much hardware and components as i could from previous builds where i had
not thrown out good parts upon its deconstruction.
     This approach worked out good, i was able to salvage a good amount parts i 
     had laying around.  There were some omponents though that i did not have on hand
     that i had to order and in the end it was Amazon or Aliexpress for those components.
     But i was able to save, i had some mechanical limit switches from a couple old
     microwave ovens i used as limit switches for each the axis as well as an old
     Rumba 3d printer board.  An T95 android tvbox to load Klipper onto and a Rigid 
     palm router.  In the end i bought all of the linear rails from Aliexpress because 
     they were cheap and i could source all of them from one vendor, it was the same for
     lead screws.  All of the wiring is recycled from old cables, the terminal blocks
     from old projects, all of the power supplies were from old 3d printers also.  
     The frame i purchased from tnutz.com, they are really reasonable on their 202 
     extrusion pricing for here in the US.   The aluminum plates that you see in the build
     were sourced locally, those are made from 0.25" x 4" aluminum flat bar, i used my
     drill press to drill all of the holes.  All of the bolts i sourced on Amazon
     and i could have probably gotten a better deal if i shopped around more but i 
     found it easier to go on Amazon for this aspect.  The big 2"x2" extrusions you see
     for the x axis, those are recycled fom a previous project.  I should mention also that 
     i cut those with my miter saw, a special metal cutting blade was not utilized
     in the saw and it cut fine.  I did go slow though as i brought the blade down.
     The enclosure for all of the electronics is an old desktop pc case case.  I chose
      because at the time it seemed like it had enough room to house all of the electonics 
      to control everything, its snug but i think i got away with it.

      I ordered the four TB6600 stepper drivers off of Amazon, they were cheap enough 
      and i didn't fell like waiting 3 weeks for the boat arrive.  The stepper driver
      socket adapters i ordered off of Aliexpress.

      From the pictures you can see I'm a big zip-tie user, a trip to Lowes or Home Depot
      and you can get a bag of 2-500 with a bunch of different colors.

      I mentioned earlier about utilizing an android tvbox for loading klipper on
      to and i know that some of you read that and are like, "This guys is an idiot!".
        Cool your jets, most that say that i don't think have really looked into it.
          From my stand point since I'm such a newbie at this and I'm already familiar 
          with Klipper and how it works for the macros and the features that are included with
           the web-ui's.  To me it just makes sense for the amount of work i will be doing
            on it as well.  I don't plan to run this machine as a production machine but
             rather just for one-offs that i will utilizing for other projects.  So, i believe 
             there will be some trade-off but this will suit me just fine.  

             Please, go through this literature, inspect the models, get inspiration for your 
             design, or build one!  Thanks to all of the other designers that came before
              me and that were willing to contribute to this effort.  I will try to remember
              to start adding some credits at the bottom of this page when i get time.
